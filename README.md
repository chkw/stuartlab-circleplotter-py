This git repository contains some sample data files and a Makefile for running the python (v2.7) script.  Executing the command 'make plot' should generate some sample CircleMap image files on your machine.

To plot your own CircleMaps, you can put your own data files in the data directory and then make the corresponding changes to the makefile.
